# Definition of Done

## The Standing Checklist

Apply this to every change before declaring it done.

### Correctness
- [ ] All acceptance criteria for the task are met
- [ ] Code runs and behaves as intended, verified at runtime, not just compiled or typechecked
- [ ] New behavior is covered by tests that fail without the change and pass with it
- [ ] Existing tests still pass; no regressions introduced
- [ ] Edge cases and error paths are handled, not just the happy path

### Quality
- [ ] Code reveals intent through naming and structure; no comments needed to explain *what* it does
- [ ] No duplicated business logic
- [ ] No dead code, debug output, or commented-out blocks left behind
- [ ] Changes are scoped to the task; no unrelated refactors snuck in
- [ ] Linting and formatting pass

### Integration
- [ ] Change works with the rest of the system, not just in isolation
- [ ] Database migrations, config changes, and feature flags are accounted for
- [ ] Backward compatibility considered for any public interface or API change

### Documentation
- [ ] Public interfaces, APIs, and user-facing behavior are documented
- [ ] Architectural decisions worth preserving are recorded 
- [ ] Documentation describes the current state in timeless language, not the change history

### Ship-readiness
- [ ] Security implications reviewed for any untrusted input, auth, or data handling 
- [ ] Observability in place for new critical paths (logs, metrics, traces) 

## Apply

- **Per task**: confirm the Correctness and Quality sections before checking the task off.
- **Per feature**: confirm Integration and Documentation before considering the feature complete.
